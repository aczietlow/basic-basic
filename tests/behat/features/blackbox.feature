Feature: Getbootstrap smoke testing
  As an anonymous user
  I should be able to navigate through website pages using Nav buttons


  Scenario: Open home page and find text
    Given I am on "http://getbootstrap.com/"
    Then I should see text matching "Bootstrap is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system."
    When I follow "Get started"
    Then I should see text matching "Get started with Bootstrap"
    When I follow "Layout"
    Then I should see text matching "Components and options for laying out your Bootstrap project, including wrapping containers, a powerful grid system, a flexible media object, and responsive utility classes."
